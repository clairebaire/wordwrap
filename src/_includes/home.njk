    <p class="tdbc-lead">We've each been developers for over a decade and watched the web evolve while we - like many of you - tried to keep up.</p>
    
    <p>Our past involves working together at an in-house marketing agency, after which our paths diverged to areas such as insurance and financial tech, design systems leadership, front-end focused software engineering, and accessibility. Now we're back together as SWE at Microsoft. We have experience across the front-end spectrum, inclusive of HTML, CSS, JS, and the surrounding ecosystem of frameworks and systems. You can get to know us more on <a href="/about/">our About Us page</a>.</p>
