## Steph Notes

I'm a web developer largely because I love the instant gratification of _writing words_ and _making a thing happen_ which is why I imagine my following quote from the show to be largely true:

> ...what I think we can agree on as builders of the web is that if nothing else - we all love to tinker, right?

And the abilty for anyone to begin tinkering on the web has seemed to simultaneously strengthen and weaken in recent years. The ways that it has become easier - like "improved" WYSIWYG editors or more fully designed CSS and JavaScript frameworks - seem to also encourage bad practices and accessibility violations. But those fundamental languages - and in particularly their individual ecosystems - have strengthened. But lest we not forget, _with great power comes great responsibility_...

With that in mind, it was important to me to also highlight that your pathway into the web and the context in which you work on web technologies strongly shapes the lens with which you view the web.

I know it's a lot (too much) to ask for everyone on the web to remain respectful ðŸ˜…, but I hope that we can move toward education being a stronger response than ridicule when someone has a misguided opinion about web fundamentals and technologies (abusive behavior being the exception, that should definitely be called out and shut down).

Keep in mind newbies are watching and what kind of feeling do we want them to walk away with - encouraged or discouraged?
