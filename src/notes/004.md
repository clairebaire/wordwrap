## Steph Notes

In case it wasn't clear how much I love Eleventy, I forgot to mention in the episode that I also author [11ty.Rocks](https://11ty.rocks) which is a growing collection of plugins, config snippets, and other tips. I have a few other big irons in the fire right now, but I do want to provide more longform tutorials.

If you're looking for a way to get started with Eleventy, I can offer you [my 20 minute video course on egghead](https://5t3ph.dev/learn-11ty) or [this 11ty.Rocks tutorial](https://11ty.rocks/posts/create-your-first-basic-11ty-website/).

Eleventy is also encouraging to [starter templates](https://11ty-netlify-jumpstart.netlify.app/) and mine comes with a minimal Sass framework. Or, I also have the [Sass Skeleton Starter](https://github.com/5t3ph/11ty-sass-skeleton) which comes with no opinions other than setting up your build process to use Sass. And there's a whole lot of [starters from the commmunity](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) listed on 11ty.dev.

...and I could link more of my resources or you could just go visit [11ty.Rocks](https://11ty.rocks) ðŸ˜‰ Be sure to check out the links to other community resources in the webring at the end of the page!
