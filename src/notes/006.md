## Steph Notes

This episode is strongly Claire's show, so my only offering is my [web component generator](https://11ty-web-component-generator.netlify.app/) that I created with Eleventy. And I would love for you to try it out and improve it! Cheers ðŸ˜Š

## Claire Notes

Web Components are awesome. We've been preaching components for _years_ and now we've got them! Now that [IE 11 is officially on its death bed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/m365-ie11-microsoft-edge-legacy) it's only a matter of time until you can make the case to stop supporting it. Anyway, I mentioned a few websites / things during the podcast, such as:

- [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/)
- [Webcomponents.org](https://www.webcomponents.org/)

I didn't mention this, but meant to - Microsoft has its own LitElement clone, [FASTElement](https://www.fast.design/), that also combines a design system. I'll admit - I don't like this as much as LitElement. It uses derived functions for its lifecycle hooks - [take this example](https://www.fast.design/docs/fast-element/defining-elements#basic-elements) and scroll to the code snippet that has `greetingChanged()` in it. These seem easy to use, but it increases the learning curve since `greetingChanged()` isn't inherent to FASTElement, but rather something FASTElement arbitrarily understands at runtime. I can delve more into this in another episode sometime.

There are several ways to link your web components together. You can use familiar concepts like Redux (which although known for usage with React is actually agnostic!), routers, etc. They're all searchable on Webcomponents.org.

I'd love to hear what you thought of my Web Components evangalism - let me know at [@tackjhompson](https://twitter.com/tackjhompson) on Twitter, or you can also mention the show at [@wordwrapshow](https://twitter.com/wordwrapshow).
