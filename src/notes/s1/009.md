- [Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/understanding-techniques)
- Advanced Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) and its incorporation into Chromium browser color pickers:
  - [Edge 89 release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/whats-new/2021/01/devtools#new-color-contrast-calculation---advanced-perceptual-contrast-algorithm-apca)
  - [Chrome 89 release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-devtools-89/#apca)
- The one about zoom: [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.10: Reflow](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html)
- [Resources about touch/target sizing](https://twitter.com/5t3ph/status/1368005568980475905)

And lastly, my [Twitter thread on assessing keyboard accessibility](https://twitter.com/5t3ph/status/1368219148954841094) (non-exhaustive, but a good starting point).
