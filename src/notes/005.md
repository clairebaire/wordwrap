## Steph Notes

I hope you picked up on our enthusiasm for the topic of color contrast in this episode.

It's something that is _so easy_ to get right, but also _so easy_ to get wrong.

By easy to get right, I mean it's technically easy to arrive at appropriately contrasting colors thanks to the tooling available to help you check. But I come from a background of 8+ years as a developer in a marketing/advertising. So I very much know the struggle of communicating back to designers (that may not typically do web stuff) that yes, you need to fix this, I understand you have a brand toolbox with precisely predefined color values.

Sometimes this means flipping the light/dark values. You can get a softer palette of text if you use a dark background. I actually went this direction on [ModernCSS.dev](https://moderncss.dev) specifically because I wanted to use a rainbow palette.

It may involve extra creativity and collaboration but it absolutely both _can_ and _should_ be resolved.

Here is a [Twitter thread of contrast utilities](https://twitter.com/5t3ph/status/1319638231152021505) that I compiled a few months ago - share widely, and let's make the web more contrast friendly in 2021!
